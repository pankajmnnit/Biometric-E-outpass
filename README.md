A javaservlet based web application to simply process of filling outpass in colleges. Problem Scenarios: In engineering college student who live in hostel have to fill outpass before going for outing during holidays and for other purposes. I have developed a complete e-outpass which saves time of student to manullay fill outpass and the warden of the hostel who confirms the outpass request. In this student &amp; warden can fill or confirm outpass using my web application.
